# SpendAnalyzer
This tool is to visualize the data presented in your bank statement as an interactive visualization and understand where you spend the most money. Additionally, the tool will recommend alternative ways to spend and save money based on existing data.

### Motivation 
I often ignore the bank statements that my bank provides because they are verbose. I eventually end up spending time doing my own accounts in Excel and figuring out who I need to charge on Venmo at the end of the month and check if everything is up to date. I see a common trend of eating out often in my spending habits. This tool would make the process of seeing the trends in my spending habits easier and also help me keep my accounts up to date plus budget my monthly expenditures.

### Scope
This dashboard was meant mainly for my personal use. However, one might find the categorization using LinearSVC useful. The parser is specific to bank statements so a new parser is all you'd need to view your own data. 

### Technologies 
Python, Pandas, Flask, Sklearn, Matplotlib, ChartJS
